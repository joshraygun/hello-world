# hello-world

Is it cool that I use the same hello world repository last semester in CSC425 as I do now in CSC430?

Guess we'll find out. Hello, again.

I love the Head First series and can definitely see some parallels between their pedagogy and your teaching style. And that is a good thing. Hope we get to see some more XKCD comics in the slides to come. Classic.
